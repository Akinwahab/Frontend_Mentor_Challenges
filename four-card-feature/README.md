## My process

### Built with

- Semantic **HTML5 markup**
- **CSS custom properties**
- **Flexbox** for layout
- **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I learned

This project helped me practice **responsive layouts with Flexbox**.
Here’s a small CSS snippet I’m proud of:

```css
.cards {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 2rem;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.card-group {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 2rem;
  flex: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I’d like to:

* Explore adding animations or transitions for smoother hover effects.

### Useful resources

* [CSS Tricks: A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) – Super useful guide while structuring the layout.
* [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/).
