## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project reinforced my understanding of using **CSS custom properties** and applying the **BEM naming convention** to keep styles organized. I also practiced using `@font-face` to load local fonts instead of relying on Google Fonts.

Example snippet I’m proud of:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Figtree";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf") format("truetype");
  font-weight: 500 800;
  font-style: normal;
}

.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-4px);
}

```

### Continued development

Going forward, I’d like to:

* Practice more with **responsive layouts** for different screen sizes.
* Explore **accessibility improvements** (like keyboard focus states).
* Try rebuilding the same card with a CSS framework (Tailwind or Bootstrap) for comparison.

### Useful resources

* [MDN Web Docs - @font-face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) – Helped me properly load the local Figtree font.
* [MDN Web Docs - BEM Methodology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/BEM) – Useful for organizing CSS class names.
