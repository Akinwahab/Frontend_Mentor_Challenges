# Akara Recipe Page

This is my solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm).
I customized it to showcase **Akara (bean cakes)**, a popular West African dish.

## My process

### Built with

* Semantic **HTML5** markup
* **CSS custom properties** for colors and typography
* **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** for layout
* **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I learned

This project helped me practice combining semantic HTML with clean design.
I specifically learned how to:

* Keep typography readable on both mobile and desktop

Example code Iâ€™m proud of:

```css
.recipe__nutrition table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
}

```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

* Improve **accessibility**. 
* Experiment with **CSS clamp()** for fluid typography
* Practicing with more advanced responsive layouts
