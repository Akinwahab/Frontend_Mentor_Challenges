## My process

### Built with

* Semantic **HTML5** markup
* **CSS custom properties**
* **Flexbox** for layout
* **Mobile-first workflow**

### What I learned

Working on this challenge reinforced how important **accessible links** and **hover states** are for user experience.

For example, I used `rel="noopener noreferrer"` along with `target="_blank"` for security:

```html
<a href="https://x.com/akinwahabcodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X</a>
```

### Continued development

In the future, I’d like to:

* Explore adding animations or transitions for smoother hover effects.
* Make the card more dynamic.

### Useful resources

* [MDN: target & rel attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#attr-rel) – helped me understand why `noopener noreferrer` is important.
* [CSS Tricks: Centering in CSS](https://css-tricks.com/centering-css-complete-guide/) – super useful for flexbox alignment.
